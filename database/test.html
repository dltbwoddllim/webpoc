  <title>Upbit and Crypto in South Korea</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h3>First off, let’s give a loud cheer to Upbit, South Korea's top crypto exchange. It's like the BTS of exchanges - recently scoring second place globally in terms of trading volume, even outpacing giants like Coinbase and OKX.</h2>

  <p>🇰🇷 South Korea is crazy over crypto
  Upbit is growing against market trend:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In July, Coinbase’s volume dropped by 11.6% and OKX’s by 5.8%</li>
    <li>Upbit’s volumes increased by a whopping $42.3%</li>
    <li>While Binance’s trading volume is still 7x that of Upbit, Binance has users user all around the globe</li>
    <li>Upbit exclusively operates in South Korea.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Korea’s got some tight regulations in place – think of it as their way of ensuring everyone plays fair in the crypto sandbox. Planning to deposit or withdraw cryptocurrency? You'll need a non-anonymous CEX account. And if you're depositing fiat, only a KYC-verified Korean bank account will do.</p>

  <h3>🌶️ The Kimchi Premium</h3>
  <p>Now, here's where things get ‘spicy’: the "kimchi premium". It's not about the traditional fermented dish, but the gap in crypto prices between Korea and the rest of the globe.</p>
  <p>Typically, it's a modest 2% difference. But occasionally, this premium gets a caffeine boost and shoots up.</p>

  <h3>🪙 $SEI drama on Upbit</h3>
  <p>For instance, the SEI token recently appeared on Binance and shortly after, graced Upbit.</p>
  <p>Thanks to some market peculiarities and withdrawal pauses on other exchanges, SEI's price on Upbit soared, hitting a staggering 170% premium ($0.23 vs $0.63). This disparity drove up the trading volume of SEI and led to a surge in its prices in other global exchanges as well.</p>

  <p>Keep your eyes on Korea
  Koreans are among the most passionate about cryptocurrency globally. Even in bear markets, their enthusiasm remains high. By keeping an eye on Korea's market movements, savvy investors can capitalize on unique opportunities like the kimchi premium and potentially see impressive gains.</p>
